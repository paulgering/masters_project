# Masters project - Analysis and visualisation code 
PSY_6009 masters project page: <https://paulgering.github.io/masters_project/>. 

This github project shares the code that was used to analyse and visualise data from a longitudinal RCT investigating the effectiveness of the "BBC Tiny Happy People Programme". The title of the project is "Predicting early vocabulary development from infant prelinguistic communication and caregiver responses". The full RCT was pre-registrered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) (<https://osf.io/kme68/>) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04919343), and a paper has been submitted for publication analysing the 12-month data from this RCT (Salter et al., submitted). This project was pre-registered on the OSF (<https://osf.io/t4r3u>). These sources will provide further information relating to the wider context of this R code. 

The project was coded using R version 4.2.2 and RStudio Version 2023.06.0+421 on a Windows 10 PC.

/raw contains the raw data used for this project. The codebook is also contained within this folder, which describes the structure of the raw data in the csv file "SCC_ID_data_UNBLINDED_stage1". Please note that this file has not been shared on this repository to avoid unblinding members of the research team for the full RCT. Rather, a blinded version of the dataset has been shared without the condition allocation called "SCC_ID_data_blinded_stage1". 

/figs contains the figure produced from this project as a png.
