# Predicting Early Vocabulary Development from Infant Prelinguistic Communication and Caregiver Responses.  
PSY_6009 masters project page: <https://paulgering.github.io/masters_project/>. 

This github project shares the code that was used to manage, analyse and visualise data from a study investigating the predictive value of infant prelinguistic communication and caregiver responses for early vocabulary development. This project is part of a wider randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the effectiveness of the "BBC Tiny Happy People Programme" as an online parent-focused intervention.

The full RCT was pre-registrered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) (<https://osf.io/kme68/>) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04919343), and a paper has been submitted for publication analysing the 12-month data from this RCT (Salter et al., submitted). This project was pre-registered on the OSF (<https://osf.io/t4r3u>). These sources provide further information relating to this project and the full RCT. 

The project was coded using R version 4.2.2 and RStudio Version 2023.06.0+421 on a Windows 10 PC.

/figs contains the figure produced from this project as a png. 

/raw contains the raw data used for this project. The codebook is also contained within this folder, which describes the structure of the raw data in the csv file "SCC_ID_data_UNBLINDED_stage1". Please note that this file has not been shared on this repository to avoid unblinding members of the research team for the full RCT. Rather, a blinded version of the dataset has been shared without the condition allocation called "SCC_ID_data_blinded_stage1". 

This project uses the renv package to ensure reproducibility of the output.
